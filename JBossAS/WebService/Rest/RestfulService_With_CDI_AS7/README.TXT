As we are already aware that JBossAS 7.1 is a Fully EE6 certified Application Server. It provides implementations of most needed features like “RestEasy WebService” And “CDI” injection. You might have already seen/read some of the demos of RestEast webservices in our previous articles. But here in this article we are going to focus on following points .

Point-1). How to developand use the JAX-RS resteasy implementations and various annotations associated with it on JBoss AS7.1.1.Final.

Point-2). How to use the CDI Injection of @javax.inject.Named Beans using @javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped inside our RestEasy WebServices. And will see that why do we need “beans.xml” file.

Point-3). How and why to use the annotations like @javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlRootElement.

Point-4). How to write a Pure RestEasy Standalone Client to access the RestEasy WebService.
